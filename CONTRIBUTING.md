## Commits

We use [convention commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) style of commit messages.

## Development

This project uses:

- **TypeScript 5.x** with strict mode
- **React 18/19** compatibility
- **Lerna** for monorepo management
- **Storybook** for development and testing

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run build          # Build all packages
npm run clean          # Clean all build artifacts
npm run start          # Start Storybook development server
npm run start:stories  # Alternative to start Storybook
npm run lint           # Run ESLint
```

## Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) style of commit messages.

Examples:

```
feat: add new chart type
fix: resolve tooltip positioning issue
docs: update installation guide
chore: bump dependencies
```

## Style

The codebase is written in TypeScript with strict mode enabled. We use ESLint for code style enforcement.

You can run `npm run lint` to check for style issues.

### Guidelines

- Use Promises instead of callbacks
- Files should be 100 lines or less when possible
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Add proper type definitions for all public APIs

## Tests

Tests are implemented using Storybook. Please see existing stories for recommended formatting and add stories for new components.
